BSides Cairo is dedicated to providing a harassment-free, constructive, inclusive and pleasant atmosphere for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of conference participants in any form.
Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund.
We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

**If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible.**
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want all participants to be happy at our event.
Contact a conference volunteer, identified by a volunteer shirt/lanyard, the volunteer will get one of the organizers to take your report, or you can contact an organizer directly, identified by an organizer shirt/lanyard.
